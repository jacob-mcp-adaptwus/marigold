# Blog Template System Guide

This guide explains how to use the new blog template system to easily add and manage your blog posts.

## Overview

The blog template system consists of several components that work together to make adding and managing blog posts simple and efficient:

1. **Data Structure** (`src/data/blogPosts.ts`) - Centralized blog post data
2. **Blog Template** (`src/components/blog/BlogTemplate.tsx`) - Reusable blog post component
3. **Blog Management Page** (`src/pages/BlogManagementPage.tsx`) - Admin interface for managing posts
4. **Blog Post Creator** (`src/components/blog/BlogPostCreator.tsx`) - Quick form for adding new posts
5. **Updated Blog Page** (`src/pages/BlogPage.tsx`) - Public blog listing with search and filters

## Quick Start: Adding a New Blog Post

### Method 1: Using the Blog Post Creator (Recommended)

1. Navigate to the blog management page (you'll need to add this to your routing)
2. Click "Add New Post" button
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **Title**: Your blog post title
   - **Description**: Brief description of the post
   - **Author**: Your name or the author's name
   - **Category**: Select from predefined categories
4. Optionally add:
   - **Read Time**: e.g., "5 min read"
   - **Tags**: Keywords for better searchability
5. Click "Save Post"

### Method 2: Direct Data Entry

1. Open `src/data/blogPosts.ts`
2. Add a new blog post object to the `blogPosts` array:

```typescript
{
  id: "your-unique-id",
  title: "Your Blog Post Title",
  description: "A compelling description of your blog post that will appear in the preview.",
  date: "Jan 15, 2025",
  author: "Your Name",
  readTime: "5 min read",
  category: "AI Marketing",
  link: "/blog/your-post-slug",
  tags: ["AI", "Marketing", "Strategy"],
  featured: false
}
```

## Best Practices

## Troubleshooting
